## Document Organization and Folders

Organize your docs into intuitive folder structures. You create top-level folders for projects like `Roadmap` or `API Docs`, then add subfolders for specifics.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Folder" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to your workspace root. Click the `+ Folder` button and name it `Project Alpha`.

    ```
    Folder Structure Example:
    - Project Alpha/
      - Planning/
      - Development/
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nest Subfolders" icon="folder">
    Inside `Project Alpha`, add `Planning`. Drag docs between folders to reorganize.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reorder" icon="move">
    Use drag-and-drop to set hierarchy. Folders support unlimited nesting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

      height="400"
    />

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Search and Tagging

Leverage powerful search. Query across all docs, filter by tags.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Full-text Search | Finds matches in titles, content, metadata |
| Tags | Add `urgent`, `draft`, `published` for filtering |
| Advanced Filters | Date range, folder, author |

Add tags directly in the editor UI.

## Version Control for Docs

Every edit creates a version. View history, compare diffs, restore.

<Expandable title="Advanced Version Workflow" default-open="false">
  Access via doc menu: `History > Compare v1.2 with v1.0`.

  ```javascript
  // API example for programmatic access
  const versions = await mps.docs.getVersions('doc-id');
  console.log(versions); // Array of {id, date, author, changes}
  ```
</Expandable>

## Export and Sharing Options

Export formats suit any need. Share links expire or require auth.

<CodeGroup tabs="Markdown,PDF,HTML">
  ```markdown
  # My Doc
  Content exports perfectly.
  ```
  ```bash
  mps export doc-id --format pdf --output ./docs.pdf
  ```
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>Generated HTML</html>
  ```
